## Some bugs that I faced:    

fun fact: vectors can be dynamically allocated without the use of pointers. see here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6775643/allocating-vectors-or-vectors-of-vectors-dynamically
if we try to use pointers, syntax highlighting will break; but the code compiles normally.
